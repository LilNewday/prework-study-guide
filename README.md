# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Every piece of important information that i've learned is highlighted in these notes and hopefully come across as not overwhelming. It may not solve everything, but you should be able to come back to this as a refresher on some basic knowledge.
