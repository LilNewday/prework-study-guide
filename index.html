          <li>The [meta] element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The [script] element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The [charset] element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The [http-equiv] element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The [viewport] element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>the [h1-h6] elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The [p] element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The [ul] element represents unordered list.</li>
          <li>The [ol] element represents ordered list.</li>
          <li>The [li] element represents list items.</li>
          <li>The [img] element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The src attribute of an image defines the location of the image or "source".</li>
          <li>The [br] element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The [a] element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The [footer] element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A [margin] indocates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A [padding] indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>A [selector] defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>To apply a rule to all of the elements visible on a page you use a special wildcard symbol or *.</li>
        <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma allowing the declaration to affect both selectors.</li>
        <li>To apply CSS code to HTML you need to use the HTML link element. </li>
        <li>The [box-shadow] CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways such as with semantic references like red or white or it's hexadecimal code.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>console.log allows you to output a message on the web via an argument.</li>
        <li>Right click and click the inspect button on your browser then click console to view your code in action.</li>
        <li>An [if] statement introduces decision making into the code.</li>
        <li>An [if] statement can only be executed when the proper conditions are met or it is true.</li>
        <li>[===] Acts as a strict equality operator that checks to see if two values are equal and returns true if the values are equal or false if the values are not equal.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable used to hold a group of data.</li>
        <li>Strings need to be contained in quotation marks. Numbers and Boolean values do not.</li>
        <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential meaning the first item in an array starts with a 0.</li>
        <li>A [for] loop is used to run through each item in an array without having to manually check through them all.</li>
        <li>A [for] loop contains three imortant statements:</li>
        <li>The starting point of the loop which contains a variable like x and it's given value like 0.</li>
        <li>The condition for example until it runs everything in the array whcih you would use the arrays [.length] for.</li>
        <li>The final statement allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
        <li>x++ is a shortcut for x+1 that allows the array loop through every item.</li>
        <li>You can comment out code to make it inactive without deleting it with /* at the beginning of the code and */ at the end of the code.</li>
        <li>A function is simply put a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>A function is different from a [for] loop and conditional statement because it must be called in order to be executed instead of being done automatically and it can be called whenever.</li>
        <li>Using a function allows the code to be more easily reusable because we can call it as many times as we need.</li>
        <li>The ability to call a function whenever means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
        <li>A function is usually followed by parentheses.</li>
        <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of Javascript's built in math object that can be used together to create a random number generator.</li>
        <li>To call a function simply type the function() again and if everything is correct it should read it back out for you.</li>
